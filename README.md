# Iris-Exploratory-Data-Analysis with Machine Learning
It contains visualizations and exploratory data analysis of the legendary Iris Species Dataset. This repository primarily exploratory visual analysis of the Iris Data. I have tried my best hope you like it.

# To download the dataset folllow this link: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris/downloads/iris-species.zip

# Here I am sharing the link of the wikipedia page of this dataset to get little more information about it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set

This dataset is widely used for machine learning practices. I am here initially doing an exploratory analysis of the datato gain some insights. 

# Install:

I am using Python 3.6.1 for this analysis. You need to install the folowing Python libraries.

1) NumPy (for documentation:http://www.numpy.org/)
2) Pandas (for documentation:http://pandas.pydata.org/)
3) Matplotlib (for documentation: https://matplotlib.org/)
4) Seaborn (for documentation: https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

I have used Jupyter Notebook for the data exploration. 

# Data: 
You can see the data in 'Iris.csv' file.

# Code:
The exploratory data analysis file is in 'iris_notebook.ipynb' file.
